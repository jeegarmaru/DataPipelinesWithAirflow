# DataPipelinesWithAirflow

## Description
This project contains code to create data pipelines to transfer music-related dataset from S3 to Redshift using Apache Airflow.

This was built as part of the DataPipelinesWithAirflow section of the Udacity Data Engineering Nanodegree program.

To run this, point Airflow to the repo's root directory & modify any config parameters & you should have a Airflow DAG that does the above.
